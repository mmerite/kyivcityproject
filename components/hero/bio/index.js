             either visual (watercolouring and graphic drawing), or physical (dancing), or audible (singing).

             My current main visual media is watercolour, since I love the water itself and enjoy its spontaneity.
             In a working process, I consider it an equal partnership between myself, the water, the paper and the paint, and I like to watch how the image is born out of it.
             Basically, all my art is the way of exploration and self-study, through finding a harmony between what I see outside, what emerges on paper and what is inside of me at the moment of creation. </p>
