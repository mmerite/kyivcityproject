                My main visual media has always been watercolour, since I loved the water itself and enjoyed its spontaneity.
                In a working process, I considered it an equal partnership between myself, the water, the paper and the paint, and I liked to watch how the image was born out of it.
                Basically, all my art was the way of exploration and self-study, through finding a harmony between what I saw outside, what emerged on paper and what was inside of me at the moment of creation. {'\n'} {'\n'}
